# OIBSIP_Task1
---------------

This is the first task in level-1 of my Web Development and Design internship.
The task is to create a Landing Page using HTML and CSS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've created a landing page of an organization named "OPEN DOOR"(named by myself) that is used to search for houses for rent or to 
buy according to one's preferences.
The Landing Page that I created shows the basic elements(non-functional) which makes us to move further(if implemented) with buying a dwelling place. 
It shows the types of houses that are available right there. If one wants to view all the related houses, then they can hit on 'Explore>>' button.
