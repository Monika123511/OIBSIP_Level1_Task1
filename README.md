ABOUT LANDING PAGE
---------------------
I've created a landing page of an organization named "OPEN DOOR"(named by myself) that is used to search for houses for rent or to 
buy according to one's preferences.
The Landing Page that I created shows the basic elements(non-functional) which makes us to move further(if implemented) with buying a dwelling place. 
It shows the types of houses that are available right there. If one wants to view all the related houses, then they can hit on 'Explore>>' button.

FILES & FOLDERS

"images" folder contains all the images that I used to create Landing Page.
"landing_page.html" file has the HTML code which is used to display the content on the page.
"landing_page.css" file contains the CSS code that I used to style the content in a proper manner.
